This project contains some utilities and scripts that wrap the tweepy tool for the
twitter API. Our purpose is to find patients with given diseases or symptoms and then
download their timelines.

To use these tools you will need a twitter account, create an app on the twitter developer 
tools, and have consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret.
It also requires the tweepy library. I installed with pip install tweepy inside a virtual
environment.
